If you feel insignificant, you better think again
Better wake up because you're part of something way BIGGER 
You're part of something way BIGGER
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ahh, you're part of something way BIGGER
BIGGER than you, BIGGER than we
BIGGER than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret, noorigin original

Understand the truth 'bout that question in your soul
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh, take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (rise), the spirit is teachin'
Oh, I'm not just preachin', I'm takin' my own advice

Let mama let you know (let you know)
Mama's just tryin', I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it, I had to say that thing twice
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I will fight, so I fight
If you feelin' frustrated and (oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (oh)
Forgiveness is key because we're fightin' something way BIGGER
You'll never lose, we are winners
I'll be the roots, you be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah, we're part of something way BIGGER

BIGGER, you're part of something way BIGGER
BIGGER than you, BIGGER than we
BIGGER than the picture they framed us to see
Legacy, oh, you're part of something way BIGGER

Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary, you just don't know it yet
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blooooooooooooooooo0000DDDd in ya
And you're gonna rise

You're part of something way BIGGER
You're part of something way BIGGER
BIGGER than you, BIGGER than me
BIGGER than the picture they framed us to be, yeah
Ooh, ooh, you're part of something way BIGGER

Understand the truth 'bout that question in your soul (BIGGER)
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold (BIGGER)
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise, the spirit is teachin'
Oh, I'm not just preachin', I'm takin' my own advice

If you feel insignificant, you better think again
Better wake up 'cause you're part of something way BIGGER
You're part of something way BIGGER
I'll be the roots, you be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah, we're part of something way BIGGER
